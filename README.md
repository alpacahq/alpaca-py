Learn more about the API products Alpaca offers at https://alpaca.markets.

## Documentation <a name="documentation"></a>

also contains examples to get started with alpaca-py.

You can find the documentation site here: https://docs.alpaca.markets/docs/getting-started-1

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

Alpaca-py is supported on Python 3.7+.  You can install Alpaca-py using pip.

```shell
  pip install alpaca-py
```

## Update <a name="update"></a>

If you already have Alpaca-py installed, and would like to use the latest version available...

Run the following command in your terminal:

```shell

## What’s New? <a name="whats-new"></a>
If you’ve used the previous python SDK alpaca-trade-api, there are a few key differences to be aware of.

### Broker API <a name="broker-api-new"></a>
Alpaca-py lets you use Broker API to start building your investment apps! Learn more at the [Broker](https://docs.alpaca.markets/docs/broker-api) page.

### OOP Design <a name="oop-design"></a>
Alpaca-py uses a more OOP approach to submitting requests compared to the previous SDK. To submit a request, you will most likely need to create a request object containing the desired request data. Generally, there is a unique request model for each method. 

Some examples of request models corresponding to methods: 

* ``GetOrdersRequest`` for ``TradingClient.get_orders()``
* ``CryptoLatestOrderbookRequest`` for ``CryptoHistoricalDataClient.get_crypto_latest_orderbook()``

**Request Models Usage Example**

To get historical bar data for crypto, you will need to provide a ``CryptoBarsRequest`` object.

```python
from alpaca.data.historical import CryptoHistoricalDataClient
from alpaca.data.requests import CryptoBarsRequest
from alpaca.data.timeframe import TimeFrame
from datetime import datetime

# no keys required for crypto data
client = CryptoHistoricalDataClient()

request_params = CryptoBarsRequest(
                        symbol_or_symbols=["BTC/USD", "ETH/USD"],
                        timeframe=TimeFrame.Day,
                        start=datetime(2022, 7, 1)
                 )

bars = client.get_crypto_bars(request_params)
```

### Data Validation <a name="data-validation"></a>
Alpaca-py uses *pydantic* to validate data models at run-time. This means if you are receiving request data via JSON from a client. You can handle parsing and validation through Alpaca’s request models. All request models can be instantiated by passing in data in dictionary format.

Here is a rough example of what is possible.

```python

 @app.route('/post_json', methods=['POST'])
 def do_trade():
     # ...

     order_data_json = request.get_json()

     # validate data
     MarketOrderRequest(**order_data_json)

     # ...
```

### Many Clients <a name="many-clients"></a>
Alpaca-py has a lot of client classes. There is a client for each API and even asset class specific clients (``StockHistoricalDataClient``, ``CryptoDataStream``). This requires you to pick and choose clients based on your needs.

**Broker API:** ``BrokerClient``

**Trading API:** ``TradingClient``

**Market Data API:**  ``StockHistoricalDataClient``, ``CryptoHistoricalDataClient``, ``CryptoDataStream``, ``StockDataStream``

## API Keys <a name="api-keys"></a>

### Trading and Market Data API <a name="trading-api-keys"></a>
In order to use Alpaca’s services you’ll need to sign up for an Alpaca account and retrieve your API keys. Signing up is completely free and takes only a few minutes. Sandbox environments are available to test out the API. To use the sandbox environment, you will need to provide sandbox/paper keys. API keys are passed into Alpaca-py through either ``TradingClient``, ``StockHistoricalDataClient``, ``CryptoHistoricalDataClient``, ``StockDataStream``, or ``CryptoDataStream``.

### Broker API <a name="broker-api-keys"></a>
To use the Broker API, you will need to sign up for a broker account and retrieve your Broker API keys. The API keys can be found on the dashboard once you’ve logged in. Alpaca also provides a sandbox environment to test out Broker API. To use the sandbox mode, provide your sandbox keys. Once you have your keys, you can pass them into ``BrokerClient`` to get started.

## Usage <a name="usage"></a>
Alpaca’s APIs allow you to do everything from building algorithmic trading strategies to building a full brokerage experience for your own end users. Here are some things you can do with Alpaca-py.

To view full descriptions and examples view the [documentation page](https://docs.alpaca.markets/docs/getting-started-1).

**Market Data API**: Access live and historical market data for 5000+ stocks and 20+ crypto.

**Trading API**: Trade stock and crypto with lightning fast execution speeds.

**Broker API & Connect**: Build investment apps - from robo-advisors to brokerages.

### Broker API Example <a name="broker-api-example"></a>

**Listing All Accounts**

The ``BrokerClient.list_accounts`` method allows you to list all the brokerage accounts under your management. The method takes an optional parameter ``search_parameters`` which requires a ``ListAccountsRequest`` object. This parameter allows you to filter the list of accounts returned.

```python
from alpaca.broker.client import BrokerClient
from alpaca.broker.requests import ListAccountsRequest
from alpaca.broker.enums import AccountEntities

broker_client = BrokerClient('api-key', 'secret-key')

# search for accounts created after January 30th 2022.
# Response should contain Contact and Identity fields for each account.
filter = ListAccountsRequest(
                    created_after=datetime.datetime.strptime("2022-01-30", "%Y-%m-%d"),
                    entities=[AccountEntities.CONTACT, AccountEntities.IDENTITY]
                    )

accounts = broker_client.list_accounts(search_parameters=filter)
```

### Trading API Example <a name="trading-api-example"></a>

**Submitting an Order**

To create an order on Alpaca-py you must use an ``OrderRequest`` object. There are different ``OrderRequest`` objects based on the type of order you want to make. For market orders, there is ``MarketOrderRequest``, limit orders have ``LimitOrderRequest``, stop orders ``StopOrderRequest``, and trailing stop orders have ``TrailingStopOrderRequest``. Each order type have their own required parameters for a successful order.


```python
from alpaca.trading.client import TradingClient
from alpaca.trading.requests import MarketOrderRequest
from alpaca.trading.enums import OrderSide, TimeInForce

trading_client = TradingClient('api-key', 'secret-key')


# preparing order data
market_order_data = MarketOrderRequest(
                      symbol="BTC/USD",
                      qty=0.0001,
                      side=OrderSide.BUY,
                      time_in_force=TimeInForce.DAY
                  )

# Market order
market_order = trading_client.submit_order(
                order_data=market_order_data
                )
```


### Market Data API Example <a name="data-api-example"></a>
**Querying Historical Bar Data**

You can request bar data via the HistoricalDataClients. In this example, we query daily bar data for “BTC/USD” and “ETH/USD” since July 1st 2022. You can convert the response to a multi-index pandas dataframe using the ``.df`` property.

```python
from alpaca.data.historical import CryptoHistoricalDataClient
from alpaca.data.requests import CryptoBarsRequest
from alpaca.data.timeframe import TimeFrame
from datetime import datetime

# no keys required for crypto data
client = CryptoHistoricalDataClient()

request_params = CryptoBarsRequest(
                        symbol_or_symbols=["BTC/USD", "ETH/USD"],
                        timeframe=TimeFrame.Day,
                        start=datetime.strptime("2022-07-01", '%Y-%m-%d')
                        )

bars = client.get_crypto_bars(request_params)

# convert to dataframe
bars.df

```
