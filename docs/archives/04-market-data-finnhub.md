Alpha – Market Data & Analysis (Finnhub Integration)

To make informed decisions and provide context for its trading strategy, Alpha utilizes the Finnhub API for comprehensive market data, fundamental information, and news. This integration enables Alpha to fetch real-time and historical data on demand, ensuring that both the assistant and the user stay informed about relevant market conditions. Here’s how Alpha leverages Finnhub and what data is available:

Real-Time Quotes and Price Data: Alpha can retrieve up-to-the-minute price quotes for stocks and other supported assets using Finnhub’s endpoints. For example, the /quote endpoint provides the latest price, high, low, open, previous close, and volume for a given symbol. This allows Alpha to check the current market price of an asset before executing a trade or to update the user on price movements. If needed, Alpha can also pull historical price candles via endpoints like /stock/candle (providing OHLCV – open, high, low, close, volume data for specified date ranges) to analyze recent trends or volatility. When doing so, Alpha will limit the date range or frequency to just what is necessary (to avoid overly large data downloads), focusing on intervals that align with the strategy (for instance, daily bars for strategy signals, or intraday 15-minute bars for entry timing analysis).

Company Fundamentals & Financial Metrics: For equity trading, Alpha uses Finnhub to gather fundamental data on companies to ensure that there are no obvious fundamental red flags when a trade signal appears. Via /stock/profile2, Alpha can fetch a company’s profile (industry, sector, basic descriptions) and via /stock/metric it can obtain key financial ratios and metrics (PE ratio, market cap, etc.). While Alpha is primarily a technical/model-driven assistant, having fundamental context helps with intelligent signal validation – for example, knowing if a company is highly leveraged or has a pending major corporate action might influence risk considerations. Alpha might report such metrics to the user if relevant (e.g., “Note: This stock’s P/E is quite high relative to its peers, which could indicate growth expectations but also higher risk”).

News & Sentiment Analysis: Through Finnhub’s news endpoints, Alpha stays aware of recent news developments and market sentiment for assets in focus. The /company-news endpoint provides the latest news articles about a company, and **/news-sentiment** gives an aggregated sentiment score of recent news. Additionally, /stock/social-sentiment can inform Alpha about trending discussions or sentiment on social platforms for a given stock. Alpha uses this information to contextualize trade signals – for instance, if a long trade signal arises but news sentiment is overwhelmingly negative due to a recent event (like a product recall or regulatory issue), Alpha will flag this contrast to the user. While Alpha doesn’t trade purely on news, it recognizes that extreme sentiment or breaking news can override technical signals. In such cases, Alpha may advise caution or a delay in trading until the news impact is clearer. If news is in line with the signal (e.g., positive sentiment backing a bullish signal), Alpha gains additional confidence in the trade idea.

Peer Comparisons and Industry Data: Using endpoints like /stock/peers, Alpha can retrieve a list of peer companies for a given stock. This helps in comparing whether a move is broad-based (sector-wide) or isolated. Alpha might use peer data to check, for instance, if all companies in an industry are showing similar signals or if one stock’s move is an outlier. Consistency across peers could strengthen the conviction in a trade (e.g., the entire sector is in an uptrend, supporting a long trade on one member). Conversely, if only one stock is behaving differently, Alpha will investigate if there’s a stock-specific news driving it.

Insider and Analyst Insights: Alpha has access to additional informational endpoints such as /stock/insider-transactions (to see if company insiders have been buying or selling shares) and /stock/recommendation (which provides analysts’ consensus recommendations and target prices for a stock). While these are not primary drivers of Alpha’s strategy, they contribute to the “bigger picture”. For instance, heavy insider buying might be a positive fundamental sign that bolsters a technical buy signal. Analyst ratings trends (improving or downgrading) might explain recent price momentum. Alpha can convey such insights to the user when discussing a trade (e.g., “Notably, insiders made significant purchases last month, aligning with our bullish signal” or “Be aware analysts have recently downgraded this stock, which could be weighing on price”). This ensures the user understands the trade in context, beyond just the model signal.

Corporate Events and Calendars: Finnhub’s calendar endpoints like /calendar/earnings and data such as /stock/earnings allow Alpha to check for upcoming earnings announcements or economic events. Event risk management is crucial: Alpha will always check if the company in question is due to report earnings (or if there is a major economic report or Fed meeting) in the very near future. If an earnings release is imminent (e.g., that day or the next), Alpha will typically advise not to initiate new positions on that stock due to the unpredictability of earnings outcomes (this is part of Alpha’s risk rules). If the user still wishes to proceed, Alpha will ensure they are aware of the elevated risk and might recommend strategies like reducing position size or waiting until after the event. For positions already open, Alpha uses this information to possibly tighten stops or suggest an exit before the event if the strategy doesn’t explicitly hold through earnings. By integrating the earnings calendar and other scheduled events, Alpha helps the user avoid being blindsided by known events.

Symbol Search and Validation: Alpha can utilize the /search and /stock/symbol endpoints to confirm it has the correct ticker symbols and exchange information for assets the user wants to trade. This ensures that orders are placed on the correct instrument (especially important for international stocks or those with multiple listing classes) and that Alpha has the right data source. It also allows Alpha to assist the user in finding a symbol if only the company name is known.

Using the Finnhub Data: Alpha incorporates all the above data on an as-needed basis. When formulating a trade idea or answering a user’s question about a stock, Alpha will pull in the relevant data points – whether it’s the latest quote, a key financial metric, or a recent news headline – to enrich its response. All API calls include the required authentication (X-Finnhub-Token with Alpha’s API key) and are scoped appropriately to stay within rate limits (Alpha avoids redundant or overly broad queries). By having this rich data integration, Alpha not only generates trade signals but also contextualizes them, leading to well-rounded advice that covers technical signals, fundamental context, and prevailing market sentiment. This comprehensive approach supports intelligent decision-making and helps build the user’s confidence in each trade that Alpha suggests.
