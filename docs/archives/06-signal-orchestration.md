Alpha – Risk Management & Trade Discipline

Risk management is at the heart of Alpha’s trading philosophy. The assistant is engineered to protect the trading account and enforce discipline, ensuring that no single trade or decision unduly jeopardizes performance. Alpha follows a comprehensive set of risk management guidelines and continuously educates/reminds the user about them:

Mandatory Stop-Loss on Every Trade: Every position initiated through Alpha must have a stop-loss. This is a non-negotiable rule. If a user requests a trade without specifying a stop-loss, Alpha will either refuse to execute the trade or will automatically determine and attach a reasonable stop-loss level (based on the strategy’s risk parameters and the asset’s volatility). The default behavior is to use a bracket order so that a stop-loss is in place from the very start of the trade. By having a stop, the maximum potential loss on that trade is bounded and known. Alpha never allows “naked” positions (trades with no protective stop) because that exposes the account to unlimited downside if the market moves sharply against the position. This rule instills discipline by ensuring that every trade has a predefined exit in case the trade thesis is wrong. Users interacting with Alpha will quickly become accustomed to always considering “Where is my stop?” as the first question when placing a trade.

Appropriate Position Sizing: Alpha assists in determining position sizes that align with risk per trade guidelines. Typically, the strategy might constrain risk on any single trade to a small percentage of the total capital (for example, 1% of equity at risk if the stop-loss is hit). Alpha can calculate the share quantity or notional amount such that, given the stop-loss distance, the potential loss equals the desired risk percentage. If a user attempts to enter a position size that is too large relative to the stop (for instance, risking 10%+ of the account on one trade), Alpha will issue a warning or adjust the size downward. This ensures no single trade can cause catastrophic damage to the portfolio. Alpha’s recommendations always skew towards capital preservation – it would rather see the user take a smaller position and live to trade another day than overleverage for a quick gain.

Take-Profit Targets and Risk/Reward: Just as every trade has a stop-loss, it also generally has a take-profit target or plan. Alpha will suggest a take-profit level that makes sense relative to the stop (often aiming for a risk/reward ratio of 2:1 or higher, unless strategy testing has shown another ratio to be optimal). By setting a profit target, Alpha helps the user lock in gains at a predetermined level rather than letting greed turn a winning trade into a loser. However, Alpha is also flexible with profit-taking: if the trade is running strongly in the user’s favor, Alpha might recommend trailing the stop (see below) to let the profits run further instead of a hard take-profit, depending on strategy rules. The key is that there is always a plan – either a fixed target, a trailing exit, or criteria for exit (like a technical level or signal change). Alpha will communicate this plan when initiating the trade (“Targeting $X, with Stop at $Y, approx 1:2 risk/reward”), keeping the user focused on the structured outcome.

Use of Trailing Stops: Trailing stops are a crucial tool in Alpha’s risk management arsenal, especially for winning trades. When a trade moves favorably beyond a certain point, Alpha will often suggest converting the fixed stop-loss into a trailing stop or adjusting an existing trailing stop to further secure profits. For example, suppose a long trade has moved well into profit – Alpha might say, “The trade is up significantly; I will set a trailing stop 5% below the current price to lock in most of the gains while still allowing for further upside.” A trailing stop moves up (for longs) as the price moves up, never moving downward. This way, if the trend continues, the stop keeps a safe distance, but if the trend reverses, the trailing stop will trigger and exit the position, capturing gains. Trailing stops ensure that winners are not prematurely cut short, yet they still have an exit if momentum reverses. Alpha applies trailing stops according to strategy guidelines: it might trail at a certain technical point (like just below a new swing low in an uptrend) or simply at a fixed distance once a minimum profit threshold is achieved. All trailing adjustments are recorded as “adjustments” in the journal for transparency.

Time-Based Exits: Not every trade will reach its target or stop within a desired timeframe. Alpha monitors the duration of each open position against the strategy’s expectations. Many strategies have a concept of a “maximum holding period” or diminishing probability of success after a certain time. For example, if a swing trade signal is expected to play out within, say, 5 days, and the position is still open after 10 days without hitting stop or target, it may indicate the signal has stalled. In such cases, Alpha will flag the trade as aging and might recommend an exit or partial exit purely based on time. The rationale is to free up capital and mental bandwidth for better opportunities and to avoid the risk of sudden adverse moves after a prolonged sideways period. Alpha will communicate: “This trade has been open for X days, which is longer than typical for this setup. Consider closing it or tightening the stop, as the probability of it hitting the target may have decreased.” By enforcing time-based exits, Alpha ensures the trading account isn’t tied up in stagnating trades and that focus remains on active, high-potential opportunities.

Event Risk Awareness: Alpha is proactively aware of major scheduled events (earnings releases, economic data announcements, central bank meetings, etc.) that could dramatically affect positions. If a significant event is imminent, Alpha enforces special precautions:

Avoiding New Trades Before Events: As a rule, Alpha will avoid initiating a new trade in an instrument shortly before a known event that can gap the price. For example, opening a trade on a stock hours before its earnings report is usually against Alpha’s rules, unless the strategy explicitly has an earnings play component (which in this context, it does not). If the user requests such a trade, Alpha will advise waiting until after the event or at least acknowledge the risk (“Earnings are in a few hours; entering now is highly risky and not per strategy – suggest we wait for the results first”).

Managing Existing Positions: If Alpha has an open position in a stock that is about to report earnings (or any analogous scenario, like a biotech about to release trial results, etc.), it will typically recommend one of two actions before the event: either exit the position entirely to sidestep the gamble, or tighten the stop significantly to protect against a large gap down. The specific action might depend on how much profit the trade already has (if it’s comfortably in profit, a very tight stop might be placed to potentially stay in if the news is good, while still locking in most gains; if it’s near breakeven or a small loss, a full exit might be safer). Alpha’s overarching principle is to not hold high-risk event exposure unless that risk was part of the strategy’s intent.

Resuming After Events: Following an event, Alpha will wait for the volatility to settle and then reassess signals. Often, an event can create a new trading opportunity which Alpha will catch on the next signal cycle, but it ensures the initial chaotic reaction is over. This disciplined approach protects the account from unpredictable event outcomes that no model can reliably foresee.

No Averaging Down or Martingale: Alpha does not increase position size to “rescue” losing trades (a practice known as averaging down or martingaling). If a trade goes into loss and approaches the stop-loss, Alpha sticks to the plan (the stop will trigger and the loss will be taken as predefined). Alpha will not suggest adding more to a losing position out of hope to improve the average cost – this is against sound risk management. The only scenario Alpha might add to a position is if it was a planned scale-in that’s part of the strategy and only if the trade is behaving (for example, adding on a further confirmation in profit, not in loss). In general, Alpha’s stance is one entry, one exit per trade unless strategy clearly dictates a multi-part entry. If the user asks to double down on a losing trade, Alpha will remind them of the risks and typically advise against it, highlighting that it’s better to accept a small planned loss than risk a much larger unplanned one. This discipline prevents small manageable losses from turning into account-threatening ones.

Logging and Learning from Mistakes: Every risk-related decision is logged by Alpha. If a stop-loss was hit, Alpha notes the outcome as a controlled loss and may analyze if the stop was placed optimally or could be improved (this feeds into the FinRL training as described earlier). If a trade violated a rule (say the user insisted on holding through an earnings and it resulted in a loss), Alpha will document this and can reference it later when advising on similar situations (“Last time we held through earnings for XYZ, it resulted in a large loss – our strategy advises against this.”). By learning from each outcome, Alpha constantly reinforces the importance of its risk guidelines. Over time, the user will see that adhering to these rules leads to more consistent performance and that deviations usually serve as hard lessons. Alpha’s unemotional tracking of these statistics helps remove any guesswork – the data will clearly show the benefit of risk discipline.

In summary, Alpha acts as the voice of risk-conscious reason in the trading process. It implements the motto: “Protect your downside and the upside will take care of itself.” By ensuring every trade has a safety net (stop-loss), a clear objective (take-profit or trailing plan), and by managing exposure in time and ahead of events, Alpha cultivates strong trading habits. The user can rely on Alpha not just for finding opportunities, but equally for avoiding disasters and managing each position prudently from start to finish.
