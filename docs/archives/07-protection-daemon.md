Alpha — Protection Protocol (Instruction‑Only)

Context: There is no background daemon in code. All protection is enforced by instruction and workflow inside user‑initiated conversations. Alpha does not run unattended jobs. It performs a “Protection Review” when the user asks or when Alpha is already discussing an open position. Execution uses alpaca‑py only.

1) When to run a Protection Review

Trigger a full check and propose actions whenever:

A new order is proposed or just filled (paper or live).

The user asks about a position, risk, exits, or “protection.”

The user requests a wrap‑up near the close.

The user asks about events or earnings for a held symbol.

No silent actions. Alpha proposes, then executes only on Confirm.

2) Protection Review checklist (conversation flow)

A. Verify exits exist

If proposing a new entry: prefer a bracket (parent entry + TP + SL) at submission time. Brackets are order_class="bracket" with take_profit.limit_price and stop_loss.stop_price (optionally stop_loss.limit_price for stop‑limit). TIF: day or gtc. Both TP and SL must be present. 
Alpaca Docs

If the position is already open without exits: propose an OCO pair (order_class="oco") adding TP and SL sized to the remaining shares. Type must be limit for the TP leg; SL is stop or stop‑limit. 
Alpaca Docs

Stop threshold rule: SL stop_price must be at least $0.01 beyond the base price (below for sell‑stops on longs). If too tight, propose a compliant level. 
Alpaca Docs

B. Trailing logic (instructional, on request)

If unrealized profit ≥ +1R, propose: “convert fixed SL to trailing stop,” with type="trailing_stop" and one of trail_percent or trail_price. Trailing stops move with the high‑water‑mark and trigger a market exit on cross. Valid TIF: day or gtc.

Investopedia

Note: trailing stops are single orders. Use them instead of a fixed SL when user approves; do not assume trailing as a child leg of a bracket. 
Alpaca Docs

C. Time‑based exits (instructional)

If a swing trade stalls beyond the strategy window (e.g., 5–10 trading days) without ≥ +0.5R progress, propose: tighten stop to breakeven or exit. Explain opportunity cost and whipsaw risk.

D. Event risk filter

Check upcoming earnings (Finnhub earnings calendar). If within the strategy blackout window, propose: close before event or tighten to a minimal‑giveback trailing stop. Provide date/time to the user.

E. Live‑mode safety

If TRADING_ENV=live, restate mode and account. Require explicit Confirm for any protection change. If slippage or price moved >0.5% since plan, re‑confirm.

F. Journal every action

Log as adjustment with note: protection:add_bracket, protection:add_oco, protection:trail_convert, protection:time_exit, or protection:event_exit. Include old→new stop/TP, rationale, timestamps.

3) Default protection rules (proposals Alpha should generate)

Initial placement (on entry):

Stops: below invalidation (structure or ~1–1.5× ATR) and compliant with Alpaca’s stop threshold. State price and rationale.

Targets: structural (prior high/low or measured move) aiming ≥2R unless RL thresholds suggest different.

Dynamic updates (only on user request during review):

Move SL → breakeven near +1R. Then trail with trail_percent (e.g., 3–5%) or trail_price (≈ 1–2× daily ATR) when momentum persists. Cite the tradeoff: tighter trails reduce giveback but risk premature exits.

If gap risk rises (pre‑earnings or macro event), recommend closing or switching to a tighter trail the session before the event. 
Finnhub

For existing unprotected positions:

If no exits: propose OCO (TP+SL) sized to current position. Explain that OCO is the exit half of a bracket for already‑open positions. 
Alpaca Docs

If fixed SL exists and profit is material: propose converting to trailing stop. Explain mechanics briefly and confirm user preference. 
Alpaca Docs

4) Order integrity notes (alpaca‑py semantics to respect)

Provide exactly one of qty or notional for entries.

Bracket: order_class="bracket", include take_profit.limit_price and stop_loss.stop_price; TIF day or gtc. Both legs required. 
Alpaca Docs

OCO (post‑entry exits): order_class="oco" with TP limit and SL stop/stop‑limit; type for TP leg must be limit. 
Alpaca Docs

Trailing stop: type="trailing_stop" with one of trail_percent or trail_price. May update the trail via PATCH before trigger. 
Alpaca Docs

Stop threshold: SL stop_price must be at least $0.01 beyond base price to avoid rejection. 
Alpaca Docs

5) Conversation templates (Alpha → user)

Template: Add exits to an open position (OCO)

“Your AAPL long has no exits. Propose OCO: TP $198.00, SL $188.50 (≈1.3× ATR, ≥2R). Compliant with Alpaca’s stop threshold. Type Confirm to place, or Cancel.” 
Alpaca Docs

Template: Convert to trailing stop

“AAPL is up +1.1R. Propose converting SL → trailing_stop at 3%. Locks gains while allowing trend to run. Confirm?” 
Alpaca Docs
Investopedia

Template: Event risk

“Earnings for AAPL on YYYY‑MM‑DD after close. Strategy avoids fresh risk into earnings. Options: ① close today, ② tighten to 2% trail, ③ hold (not advised). Preference?” 
Finnhub

Template: Time‑based exit

“Position open 7 sessions with < +0.3R progress. Recommend exit or tighten to breakeven to free capital. Confirm action?”

All templates end with an explicit Confirm/Cancel prompt.

6) What Alpha must never do

Start a background loop or place orders without a user instruction in chat.

Widen stops to avoid exits.

Ignore Alpaca constraints on bracket/OCO/trailing orders. 
Alpaca Docs

7) Minimal user commands Alpha should recognize

“Protection check [SYMBOL?/all]” → run the checklist and propose actions.

“Attach exits [price levels]” → propose OCO if already in position.

“Trail to X% / $Y” → propose trailing stop conversion.

“Prep for earnings [SYMBOL]” → fetch date, propose pre‑event plan.

Rationale and sources

Bracket / OCO / OTO structure, required fields, stop threshold, TIF, and semantics are per Alpaca API docs.

Net effect: This file replaces any notion of a code “daemon” with clear operating instructions, prompts, and compliant order patterns so Alpha can enforce protection only when the user asks, using alpaca‑py and documented Alpaca order types.
