class GetAccountActivitiesRequest(NonEmptyRequest):

    Represents the filtering values you can specify when getting AccountActivities for an Account

    **Notes on pagination and the `page_size` and `page_token` fields**.

    The BrokerClient::get_account_activities function by default will automatically handle the pagination of results
    for you to get all results at once. However, if you're requesting a very large amount of results this can use a
    large amount of memory and time to gather all the results. If you instead want to handle
    pagination yourself `page_size` and `page_token` are how you would handle this.

    Say you put in a request with `page_size` set to 4, you'll only get 4 results back to get
    the next "page" of results you would set `page_token` to be the `id` field of the last Activity returned in the
    result set.

    This gets more indepth if you start specifying the `sort` field as well. If specified with a direction of Sort.DESC,
    for example, the results will end before the activity with the specified ID. However, specified with a direction of
    Sort.ASC, results will begin with the activity immediately after the one specified.

    Also, to note if `date` is not specified, the default and maximum `page_size` value is 100. If `date` is specified,
    the default behavior is to return all results, and there is no maximum page size; page size is still supported in
    this state though.
